# UniRemote - one remote to rule them all!
I wanted a way to control all the projects I make. It is not a remote for A/V systems.<br>
I wanted this to work not just at home in my WiFi zone but also at remote locations like a Maker Faire.<br>
Plan is to communicate with my projects via ESP-NOW WiFi

## Licensing
[Top](#uniremote-\--one-remote-to-rule-them-all "Top")<br>
This repository has a LICENSE file for Apache 2.0. There may be code included that I have modified from other open sources (such as Arduino, Espressif, SparkFun, Seeed Studio, DFRobot, etc.). These other sources may possibly be licensed using a different license model. In such a case I will include some notation of this. Typically I will include verbatim the license in the included/modified source code, but alternatively there might be a LICENSE file in the source code area that points out exceptions to the Apache 2.0 license.
