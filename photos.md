## Latest Photos - Breadboard

This is the UniRemoteCYD breadboard setup with "drone style" batteries.
- I removed the QR code reader since the RFID reader was so easy to use
- The contactless RFID PICC cards (Proximity Integrated Circuit Card) are to the left
- The "drone style" battery charger and charging cable is at the top
- The XAIO ESP32-Sense target processor is below that, attached to a USB cable
- The Cheap Yellow Display (CYD) and its RFID sensor and batteries are on the bottom right
