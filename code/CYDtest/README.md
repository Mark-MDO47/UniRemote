The display I am using was purchased here:

## Tutorials and Courses

For starters, I am using these Random Nerd tutorials:
- https://randomnerdtutorials.com/cheap-yellow-display-esp32-2432s028r/
- https://randomnerdtutorials.com/touchscreen-on-off-button-cheap-yellow-display-esp32-2432s028r/
- https://randomnerdtutorials.com/lvgl-cheap-yellow-display-esp32-2432s028r/
- https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cheap-yellow-display-cyd-pinout-esp32-2432s028r/

Then I downloaded this Random Nerd course Ebook and materials:
- https://rntlab.com/module-1/esp32-lvgl-ebook/

Copies of files that I use from those tutorials can be found in the RandomNerdFiles directory.

I am not quite sure about the course files yet; need to find out how to treat the files properly.
