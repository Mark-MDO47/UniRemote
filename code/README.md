| [code/CYDbitBangCalibrate](https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/UniRemote/tree/master/code/CYDbitBangCalibrate "CYDbitBangCalibrate") | Modified Random Nerds CYD Calibrate routine that uses the XPT2046_Bitbang software-based SPI library instead of the TFT_eSPI hardware based SPI library for the touchscreen - attributions in the code |
| [code/UniRemoteCYD](https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/UniRemote/tree/master/code/UniRemoteCYD "UniRemoteCYD") | UniRemote code with QR code reader, RFID Reader, and CYD - attributions in the code |
| [code/UniTestRcvr](https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/UniRemote/tree/master/code/UniTestRcvr "UniTestRcvr") | UniRemote code template for generic receiver of the commands - attributions in the code |

| [code/readMacAddress](https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/UniRemote/tree/master/code/readMacAddress "readMacAddress") | Code to read the WiFi MAC address of pretty much any ESP32 - used on remotes to get info - attribution in its README |
| [code/WriteRFID_CYD](https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/UniRemote/tree/master/code/WriteRFID_CYD "WriteRFID_CYD") | Code with same hardware setup as UniRemoteCYD to write RFID cards based on text strings in same format as input to QRCode.py - attributions in the code |
| [MDOpythonUtils QRCode.py](https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/MDOpythonUtils/tree/master/QRCode "QRCode.py") | Python routine to generate QR code based on directions in a text file |

| [code/CYDtest](https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/UniRemote/tree/master/code/CYDtest "CYDtest") | ESP32-2432S028R (Cheap Yellow Display or CYD) pointers to tutorials and hardware information |
| [code/RFIDRC522test](https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/UniRemote/tree/master/code/RFIDRC522test "RFIDRC522test")  | RFID RC522 pointers to tutorials and hardware information |
| [code/UniRemote](https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/UniRemote/tree/master/code/UniRemote "UniRemote") | UniRemote code with QR code reader and **generic ESP32** module - attributions in the code. This is now **unused** and **deprecated**. I am switching to the CYD and the code in **UniRemoteCYD**. |
| [code/tiny_code_reader](https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/UniRemote/tree/master/code/tiny_code_reader "tiny_code_reader") | *.h file for using the QR code reader - attribution in its README |
